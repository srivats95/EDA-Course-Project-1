## Plotting Power Consumption

### About 

This was the first project for the Exploratory Data Analysis course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track. The objective was to practice creating plots by reproducing a series of four plots, and also to practice using github by forking and cloning an existing repository.

## Sypnosis 

The goal here was simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 by reproducing a series of four plots. Due to specific image size requirements of the new plots, they will look slightly different than the originals.

## Data 

This project used data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets.

Electric power consumption Dataset (20Mb)

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site

 1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
 2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
 3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
 4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
 5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
 6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
 7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
 8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
 9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
